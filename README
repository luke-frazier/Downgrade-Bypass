This tool offers the option to install the fastboot drivers, gains a root shell using Fre3vo, puts su.zip on the sdcard and an extendedcommand file in /cache/recovery so that when the user boots to recovery it auto-flashes su. Then it starts the Revolutionary tool and opens some instruction textboxes. ~
